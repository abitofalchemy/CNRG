- Parser for subdue output works. 
- Need to feed it to the Julia / Matlab code

05/17
- Find motifs using SUBDUE using the occurrences and find conductance of the motifs using Benson
- Check if they match  
- Check if greedy does get you the optimum clusters 
- Nature of conductance plot - is it convex?
- best substructure, top-k substructures - does that make a difference?
